## Common mismatch sources

- missing globals
- different user agent branches
- DOM-derived constants
- text encoding assumptions
- `Date.now()` or randomness precision
- scheduler, timer, or microtask differences
- load-order mistakes between env surfaces, polyfills, hooks, init, and trigger
- helper functions patched by side scripts
- instance-level hooks bypassed by prototype rewrites, rebinding, or wrapper replacement
- async bootstrap state that is only consumed later from cookie, storage, or one cached object
- unimplemented native surfaces such as `canvas`, WebGL, layout metrics, or style computation that quietly collapse fingerprint or verifier payloads
- host-object contract mismatches such as descriptors, prototype chains, constructor identity, enumeration, or native-looking function surfaces
- returned child-object shape mismatches where the method exists but its produced object diverges from the browser contract
- lifecycle-semantic gaps such as live collections, indexed slots, attach or detach behavior, or objects that should exist only while attached
- JS engine or host-version drift that changes builtin availability, native function own-property lists, or constructor surfaces
- structurally shortened outputs caused by null-returning host APIs rather than wrong business logic

## Working method

1. classify the gap first: missing surface, load-order contract, or host-object contract mismatch
2. compare helper outputs on the same fixed inputs
3. compare structural metrics such as length, repeated blocks, and field presence before chasing semantics
4. identify the first diverging intermediate value
5. if cookie, storage, script, or resource injection barely changes the output, inspect which host APIs are actually probed
6. log decisive method arguments and returned child-object shapes, not only property gets, when those calls gate later branches
7. stabilize the environment in layers:
   - base DOM, BOM, and obvious scalar values
   - descriptors, prototype chains, constructor identity, enumeration, and returned-object shapes
   - higher-entropy fingerprint surfaces such as `canvas`, WebGL, audio, fonts, layout, or style only after evidence proves they matter
8. if the right names exist but probes branch on descriptors, `ownKeys`, `instanceof`, constructor checks, or native-looking functions, patch the contract before adding more globals
9. if probes depend on live collections, indexed slot persistence, or attach or detach transitions, patch the lifecycle contract at the prototype boundary instead of returning static placeholders
10. if one local engine version matches host contracts materially better than another, pin that version before rewriting more business logic
11. if hooks vanish, the artifact stays empty, or behavior changes only after bundle load, prove whether env surfaces, polyfills, hooks, init, and trigger were loaded in the wrong order
12. patch only the smallest missing environment surface or authoritative boundary that downstream code cannot bypass
13. if the runtime later only reads a server-issued cookie, storage value, token, or cached blob, test whether injecting a verified sample removes the async bootstrap from the hot path
14. allow structural failures to propagate; suppress only the exact recoverable error class you can justify
15. keep the patch local to the helper runtime, not a whole browser dependency

## Verification rule

Loading success is only a milestone.
A helper that no longer throws can still emit an empty, downgraded, or structurally wrong artifact.

Before live replay:

1. rerun the decisive artifact in the same patched environment, hook placement, and load order you plan to ship
2. compare fixed-input browser and local outputs by structure first: length, prefix, segment count, field presence, encoding, or emitted headers and body
3. for hook-driven runtimes, treat order as part of the contract:
   - environment surfaces or fake transport primitive
   - target bundle
   - capture hook or observation boundary
   - init or config
   - trigger
4. if a target polyfill or wrapper replaces your early hook, move the hook after that replacement or upward to a stable boundary every call must cross

## Boundary-selection rule

Patch the nearest stable boundary, not the prettiest one.

Prefer these boundaries over one-off instance patching when the target keeps rebinding helpers:

- prototype methods such as `XMLHttpRequest.prototype.open` or `.send`
- prototype-level DOM lifecycle hooks such as `appendChild` or `removeChild` when attachment state drives later probes
- constructor-time wrappers
- transport-wrapper ingress before mutation
- request egress after mutation but before live HTTP

If the runtime can replace one instance method and skip your patch, that patch surface is too low.

## Common traps

- patching one object instance when the runtime clones, rebinds, or replaces the method upstream
- fixing every undefined while ignoring load order between env surfaces, polyfills, hooks, init, and trigger
- replaying an entire async bootstrap when the signer only reads an already-issued cookie, storage slot, or token
- copying cookie, storage, script, or resource snapshots when the runtime actually branches on `canvas`, WebGL, layout, style, or native descriptors
- logging property gets only, while the decisive divergence sits in method arguments or returned child-object structure
- adding more globals when the real divergence is descriptor, prototype, constructor, or native-surface shape
- jumping straight to `canvas`, WebGL, audio, or font patching before base names, descriptors, and returned-object contracts are stable
- filling a host object with static values when the runtime checks live collection length, indexed slot persistence, or attach or detach lifecycle
- patching the entire DOM when only one global value was needed
- treating a much shorter verifier sidecar as an answer-quality problem instead of environment evidence
- debugging under one JS engine version and shipping under another without rerunning fixed-input parity checks
- calling the job done because the helper loads without throwing
- swallowing every runtime error and hiding recursion, stack overflow, or corrupted VM state
- blaming crypto before checking environment-sensitive branches

## Delivery rule

Prefer tiny local patches and explicit state injection over browser-backed execution.
Pin the shipped local engine version when helper parity depends on native-surface shape.

## Executable profile

When the entry, invocation contract, and fixed expected output are already known, prefer the executable diagnosis loop in `references/profiles/env-patch/index.md` over inventing ad-hoc `window` stubs. Keep pure protocol work in the Crawler Reverse Engineering core loop; use the profile only for host-surface gaps.
